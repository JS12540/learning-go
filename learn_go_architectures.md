## 📘 What to Look for When Studying Repos

When exploring these repositories, pay attention to:

### ✅ Package Structure
- How folders are organized
- Separation of concerns
- Internal vs public packages

### ✅ Interfaces
- How dependencies are abstracted
- Decoupling between layers
- Testability improvements

### ✅ Error Handling
- Explicit error returns
- Wrapping & propagation
- Logging strategy

### ✅ Concurrency
- Goroutines usage
- Channels
- Context cancellation

### ✅ Testing
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Mocking via interfaces

## 🧠 Key Learning Mindset

Instead of just reading code:

✔ Trace request flow (e.g., HTTP → Handler → Service → Repo)  
✔ Understand why interfaces exist  
✔ Study dependency injection patterns  
✔ Observe naming conventions  
✔ Compare simple vs complex modules
